                <!--the lyrics to the first verse-->
                <p>I know I have good judgement</p>
                <p>I know I have good taste</p>
                <p>It's funny and it's ironic</p>
                <p>That only I feel that way</p>
                <p>I promise 'em that you're different</p>
                <p>And everyone makes mistakes</p>
                <p>But just don't</p>
                <p>I heard that you're an actor</p>
                <p>So act like a stand up guy</p>
                <p>Whatever devils inside you</p>
                <p>Don't let him out tonight</p>
                <p>I tell them it's just your culture</p>
                <p>And everyone rolls their eyes</p>
                <p>Yeah I know</p>
                <p>All I'm asking baby</p>
